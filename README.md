# SQLProject2
This project report includes the full design and implementation of the Patient Access and Registration database for the University Medical Center. In this project a very thorough ER diagram was created to determine the tables, contents of the tables, and table relationships that would be included in the final database implementation. The ER diagram was used to guide the implementation and SQL code that was created during implementation. Included in the implementation of the database was a final count of 25 tables with constraints and other specifications, four tested views, fours tested stored procedures, four tested user defined functions, four triggers, and four tested transactions. Along with this, four scripts were also developed to create users in the database that have varying levels of security permissions. The source code, test cases, and screenshots are all included in the full report below. â€ƒ
